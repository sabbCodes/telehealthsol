# Agoric Dapp Starter: Med Rec

Med Rec is a simple Dapp for the [Agoric smart contract platform](https://docs.agoric.com/) that permits users to add medical records, in particular patient data, to Agoric blockchain. Users are given a simple form in which to enter patient's personal and medical information, and this data is sent to the contract to be added to the Agoric VStorage.

_Note that this is a toy example dapp with no consideration made for privacy of sensitive information. All entered data maybe publicly visible depending on the hosting network of this dapp._

This is the user interface of dapp:

This is how the data looks like in VStorage:

## Getting started

Detailed instructions regarding setting up the environment for Agoric dapps with a video walkthrough is available at [Your First Agoric Dapp](https://docs.agoric.com/guides/getting-started/) tutorial. But if you have the environment set, i.e., have correct version of node, yarn, docker, and Keplr wallet installed, here are the steps that you need to follow:

- run the `yarn install` command to install any solution dependencies. _Downloading all the required dependencies may take several minutes. The UI depends on the React framework, and the contract depends on the Agoric framework. The packages in this project also have development dependencies for testing, code formatting, and static analysis._
- start a local Agoric blockchain using the `yarn start:docker` command.
- run `yarn docker:logs` to check the logs. Once your logs resemble the following, stop the logs by pressing `ctrl+c`.

```

- run `yarn start:contract` to start the smart contract.
- run `yarn start:ui` to start the smart contract. You can use the link in the output to load the smart contract UI in a browser.

## How Does It Work?

The agoric platform doesn't have a special case for query methods in contracts. Instead, it has `VStorage` / `chainStorage`. When the contract receives a new record inside `offerArgs` object,we do:

```js
await storePatientData(patientData.patientId, patientData);
```

which is simply defined as:

```js
const storePatientData = async (patientId, data) => {
  const patientNode = await E(patientDataRoot).makeChildNode(patientId);
  await E(patientNode).setValue(JSON.stringify(data));
};
```

Since this contract isn't actually trading assets, the indirection around `makePublishInvitation` is unfortunate overhead. We have sketches for avoiding that eventually, but for now, that's the way it works.

On the UI side, information retrieval is implemented as a `fetch`:

```js
  const fetchPatientData = async (patientId: string) => {
    setSelectedPatientId(patientId); // Set the selected patient ID
    const response = await fetch(`${ENDPOINTS.API}/agoric/vstorage/data/published.patientData.patients.${patientId}`);
```
